"""Battle.net install orchestration — place the prefix, then watch the client.

py_modules/unifideck/stores/battlenet/install.py

Nothing here downloads a game. Battle.net is a wrapper store: the vendor
client inside the prefix owns the download, and the install is a user click
in its window. This module owns the two ends of that — what has to be true
before the click, and knowing when the click's work is done.

**Placement** is the "before". The game installs inside the prefix, so the
prefix's location is the game's location, and Wine derives ``C:``'s free space
from the filesystem under ``drive_c``. Battle.net originally ignored the
storage location the user picked, and the symptom was not a game in the wrong
folder: the client refused an 83 GB install for lack of space, quoting the
45 GB internal drive, while the SD card the user had chosen had 164 GB free.

**Waiting** is the "after", and used to be missing entirely. ``install``
returned success the moment the prefix was cloned, so the download worker
marked the game installed and the tile showed a Play button before the user had
even opened the client. It now blocks on the shared wrapper-store watcher —
the same one Ubisoft uses — and returns the real install directory.

Split out of ``store.py`` when that file hit its size cap. The seam is the
one Ubisoft already uses (``stores/ubisoft/installer/``); the placement policy
lives in ``stores/shared/prefix_placement`` and the watching in
``stores/shared/wrapper_install``.
